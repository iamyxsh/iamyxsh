# Yash Sharma (iamyxsh) 👋

Rust • ZK • Cryptography • Blockchain Systems

I’m a software engineer focused on building low-latency, security-heavy systems in Rust and shipping production-grade blockchain infrastructure. Lately I’m spending most of my time on zero-knowledge (circuits + proving systems) and post-quantum cryptography experiments, with a practical bias: benchmarks, integrations, and real deployments.

---

## What I’m good at 🧩

**Rust engineering**
- High-performance services (async, Tokio), clean APIs, and production hardening
- Systems work around networking, serialization, and performance tuning
- Writing robust tests and tooling (benchmarks, CI, profiling)

**Zero-knowledge (ZK)**
- Building circuits and proving pipelines with a “measure first” mindset
- Integrating ZK proofs into real apps (verification, constraints, proof UX)
- Interested in proof systems performance + correctness + developer ergonomics

**Cryptography + security**
- Practical protocol work (signatures, key management, threat modeling)
- Post-quantum crypto experiments (signatures / attestations / integrations)
- Security-first mindset when shipping anything that touches funds or keys

**Smart contracts + protocols**
- Solidity (Foundry/Hardhat) and onchain/offchain architecture
- DeFi protocol design, oracles, matching engines, transaction pipelines
- Cross-chain / interoperability-oriented work

---

## Tech I use (often) ⚙️

**Languages:** Rust, TypeScript, Solidity, Go  
**Rust stack:** Tokio, async services, benchmarking, profiling, clean crate design  
**ZK:** Noir and modern proving stacks (plus circuit integration patterns)  
**Blockchain:** EVM, Solana, Move ecosystems  
**Tooling:** Docker, CI, Linux, scripting, reproducible builds

## Proof of work (projects) 🔍

A few repos that reflect how I work: tight scope, clean code, and a bias toward correctness + learning-by-building.

### Zero-knowledge (ZK)

**basic-plonk-rust**  
https://github.com/iamyxsh/basic-plonk-rust  
A minimal PLONK-style implementation in Rust to understand the full proving flow (constraints → witness → proof). Built as a learning + reference repo with an emphasis on clarity.

**noir-zk-mixer**  
https://github.com/iamyxsh/noir-zk-mixer  
A Tornado-style mixer built with Noir. Focus is on practical circuit design, proving/verification wiring, and making privacy primitives feel “real”, not just theoretical.

### Post-quantum cryptography (PQC)

**dilithium-attest**  
https://github.com/iamyxsh/dilithium-attest  
Experiments around Dilithium signatures for attestations and real integration patterns. The goal is to explore how PQC fits into modern application and blockchain flows.

### Cryptography fundamentals (Rust)

**elliptic-curve-cryptography-rust**  
https://github.com/iamyxsh/elliptic-curve-cryptography-rust  
ECC from the ground up in Rust (math + primitives). I use this as a reference repo to stay sharp on the building blocks behind modern signatures and key exchange.

**rc5-block-cipher-rust**  
https://github.com/iamyxsh/rc5-block-cipher-rust  
RC5 block cipher implementation in Rust. Built to practice clean crypto code structure, test vectors, and correctness-first implementation habits.

## Experience snapshot 🧠

- Built and led delivery of complex protocol systems with multiple smart contracts + backend services
- Built circuits in Brevis and Noir, and worked on MPC infra
- Shipped production code across Rust + Solidity + TypeScript + Go
- Worked across multiple chains and ecosystems, with a strong DeFi + security bias
- Comfortable owning a feature end-to-end: design → implementation → tests → deployment → docs

---

## What I’m looking for 🎯

Roles where I can build core infrastructure with strong engineering standards:
- ZK engineer (circuits, proving, integrations, performance)
- Rust engineer (systems, infra, low-latency services)
- Cryptography / protocol engineer (security-first product work)

---

## Quick facts 📍

- Based in India (open to remote)
- Strong preference for Rust-first stacks
- Deep interest in ZK + cryptography + payments
